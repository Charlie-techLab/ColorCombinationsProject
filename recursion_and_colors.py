'''
This code provides a simple implementation to calculate and display the number
of combinations possible for a given number of colors or designs. Below is a
detailed explanation of the code and how it could be extended to incorporate
dynamic programming or recursion for more complex scenarios.

---

### **Code Explanation**

#### 1. `calculate_combinations(n)`
This function calculates the number of combinations (R) for a given number of
colors or designs (C). The formula used here is:

```
R = n * (n - 1) // 2
```

This formula computes the number of ways to choose 2 items from `n` items
without repetition (a common combinatorial calculation). For example:
- If `n = 3`, the combinations are `(1, 2)`, `(1, 3)`, and `(2, 3)`,
resulting in `R = 3`.

This function is currently a placeholder and can be replaced with more complex
logic if needed.

---

#### 2. `print_table(start, end)`
This function generates and prints a table of combinations for a range of
values from `start` to `end`. It:
- Prints a header for the table.
- Iterates through the range of values (`start` to `end`) and calculates the
combinations for each value using `calculate_combinations(n)`.
- Formats and displays the results in a readable table format.

For example, calling `print_table(1, 5)` would produce:
```
Colors/Designs       Combinations (R)
-----------------------------------
C 1 =  1 R 1 =   0
C 2 =  2 R 2 =   1
C 3 =  3 R 3 =   3
C 4 =  4 R 4 =   6
C 5 =  5 R 5 =  10
```

---

#### 3. `main()`
The `main()` function serves as the entry point of the program. It:
1. Calls `print_table(1, 23)` to display the combinations for values
from 1 to 23.
2. Prompts the user to input a specific number of colors/designs to
calculate its combinations dynamically.
3. Handles invalid input gracefully using a `try-except` block.

---

### **Dynamic Programming and Recursion**

Currently, the code uses a direct formula to calculate combinations, which is 
efficient for small inputs. However, for more complex scenarios, dynamic 
programming or recursion could be used:

#### **Dynamic Programming**
Dynamic programming is useful when the problem involves overlapping 
subproblems. For example, if we want to calculate combinations for a large 
range of values, we can store previously computed results to avoid redundant
calculations.

Example:
```python
# Using memoization to store results
combination_cache = {}

def calculate_combinations_dp(n):
    if n in combination_cache:
        return combination_cache[n]
    if n < 2:
        result = 0
    else:
        result = n * (n - 1) // 2
    combination_cache[n] = result
    return result
```

This approach avoids recalculating combinations for the same `n` multiple
times, improving efficiency.

---

#### **Recursion**
Recursion can be used to calculate combinations by breaking the problem 
into smaller subproblems. For example, the number of combinations for `n`
items can be derived recursively as:

```
C(n) = C(n-1) + (n-1)
```

Example:
```python
def calculate_combinations_recursive(n):
    if n < 2:
        return 0
    return calculate_combinations_recursive(n - 1) + (n - 1)
```

This approach is less efficient for large inputs due to repeated calculations
but demonstrates how recursion can be applied.

---

### **Potential Extensions**
1. **Dynamic Programming for Large Ranges**: Use memoization or tabulation to 
efficiently compute combinations for a large range of values.
2. **Recursive Backtracking**: Extend the logic to generate all possible 
combinations (not just count them) using recursion.
3. **Integration with Color Patterns**: Combine this logic with algorithms to 
generate harmonious color combinations based on the principles of the color 
wheel.

By incorporating dynamic programming or recursion, the project can handle more
complex combinatorial problems, such as generating combinations for larger 
datasets or applying constraints (e.g., left/right side of garments).
